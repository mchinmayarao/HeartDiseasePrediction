# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the probability of heart disease based on various clinical parameters. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) application, data preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation.

## Files

1. **Application.py:** Contains the GUI for the heart disease prediction tool.
2. **Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
3. **Report.md:** Comprehensive report outlining the project's objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.
4. **model.pkl:** Saved trained model for heart disease prediction.

## Usage

- **GUI Application:**
  - Run `Application.py` to launch the GUI. Input relevant clinical parameters and click "Predict" to obtain heart disease probability.

- **Jupyter Notebook:**
  - Open `Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment to explore the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
